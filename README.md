A simple website used to store recipes. Each recipe has a name, ingredients, instructions, an image, and recipe tags. Knockout JS is used when adding a recipe to see what the view recipe will look like before adding it to your database. You can also view, download, or print a pdf of any recipe.

This application uses [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org) 3.2.
The framework source code can be found here: [cakephp/cakephp](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp).

## Configuration

Read and edit `config/app.php` and setup the 'Datasources' and any other
configuration relevant for your application.

There is also a sample dp to use in root directory: [recipes_db_backup.sql](https://github.com/MrEx88/recipes-with-cakephp3/blob/master/recipes_db_backup.sql).
